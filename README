This project tragets to create perl implementation of 
Mediawiki parser.

Since perl and php have some lexical similarity, I would
take code from current php includes/parser/Preprocessor_DOM.php
fix the lexical diffirence and make it work properly.

Current project status: it work as a proof of concept.

Preprocessor that splits text for sections templates and tplargs 
is partly implemented.

In future I would do parsiong of html tags in Preprocessor code, and 
parsing of text formatting. 

Also I would add event based parsing, so it cam be used in the same 
way as HTML::Parser
